OBJECTIVES :
To detect food type by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
To estimate food weight and calories of food


A mixture of methods including
canny edge detection, 
watershed segmentation, 
morphological operators and Otsu’s method 
were used to segment the food item to obtain the contour of the fruit and the contour of the thumb. 
We use the thumb finger for calibration purposes. 
The thumb is placed next to the dish while clicking the photo and this thumb gives us the estimate of the real-life size of the food item and 
helps estimate volume accurately.

Limitations:
Actual weight and calories can’t find due to image quality
Difficult to find appropriate angle between fruit And camera
Lighting condition i.e pixel changes with respect to light
Scope:
Estimate the calorie from all types of fruits.
Minimize error of calories estimation
